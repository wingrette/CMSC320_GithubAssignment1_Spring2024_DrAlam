Why are you interested in taking CMSC320?
I'm interested in taking CMSC320 because data science is a growing and important
field in the modern day. With the increase in social media at least,
hours and hours of content are being created at unprecedented speeds, and 
the handling of all of it is facinating. 
I think it's great that UMD has this introductory course and I'd like
to learn more about what exactly data science is.
